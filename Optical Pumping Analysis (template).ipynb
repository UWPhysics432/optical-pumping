    "### Preliminary exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this notebook to calculate the answers to the first two exercises in the instructions: \n",
    "1. The expected fractional occupation of the lowest energy state of the rubidium atom in the Earth's magnetic field.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The values of the g-factor $g_F$ for the hyperfine energy levels of the rubidium atom's lowest-energy states for both isotopes, Rb-85 and Rb-87.  You will compare these values to your results from the measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Find the experimental values of *g<sub>F</sub>* with three different methods\n",
    "\n",
    "You will determine $g_F$ in the equation $\\Delta E = \\hbar\\omega_0 = g_F\\mu_BH_0$ (taking $\\Delta m_F =1$) using three methods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>The first method is to plot the resonant frequency (where the dip begins) versus offset of the $H_0$ sweep voltage and then determining the zero crossing of the line with a fit.  This gives a better measurement of the resonance frequency $\\omega_0/2\\pi$ in the earth's field. NOTE: You will also use the zero-frequency intercept to estimate the offset that would cancel the earth's field. (This is <b>Exercise 3</b> in the instructions.)</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>The second and third methods use the Rabi oscillations, which are done with no added $H_0$ field offset applied (so the only contribution comes from the earth field).  The second method uses the fact that the Rabi oscillation signal is strongest when the oscillator ($H_1$) frequency $\\nu$ is on-resonance: $\\nu\\approx\\omega_0/2\\pi$.  The response is very sensitive to the frequency, and you should be able to determine it to 4 significant figures by adjusting the function generator while observing the oscilloscope signal. (This is <b>Exercise 7</b> in the instructions.)</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>The third method uses the Rabi theory to measure the Rabi oscillation frequency as a function of the $H_1$ amplitude. The amplitude of $H_1$ is directly proportional to the voltage $V_{pp}$ of the $H_1$-field osillator, and the Rabi angular frequency $\\Omega$ is predicted to follow this formula (Eq. 6 in the instructions):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Omega^2 = \\omega_1^2 + (\\omega - \\omega_0)^2\\,, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hbar\\omega_1 = g\\mu_B H_1 = KV_{pp}$ with $K$ as some proportionality constant of appropriate units, and $2\\pi\\nu = \\omega$ the angular frequency of the $H_1$ oscillator.  By dividing out the $(2\\pi)^2$ in the above, you can see that a plot of Rabi frequency (in hertz) squared versus the oscillator peak-to-peak amplitude, squared, should give a straight line whose y-intercept should be the difference, squared, between the true resonant frequency $\\omega_0/2\\pi$ and the oscillator frequency $\\nu$.  The only ambiguity is whether the resonant frequency $\\nu_0$ is above or below $\\nu$.  So, if you first tune to find the frequency closest to resonance (method 2) and then detune the oscillator in a known direction (higher or lower than $\\omega_0 = 2\\pi\\nu_0$), the intercept of a line fit should give the offset to a high precision, and a better value for $\\omega_0 = 2\\pi\\nu_0$ can be found by adding (or subtracting, depending on the direction of detuning) this offset to $\\nu$. (This is <b>Exercise 9</b> in the instructions.)</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note</b> Other exercises in the instructions do not require Python coding, because they are either primarily qualitative or need only a simple calculation that can be done by hand with a calculator."
